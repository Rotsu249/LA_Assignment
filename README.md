Assignment 1 :

- Gaussian Elimination
- LU Decmposition
- Gauss Jordan

Remarks :
   -> All 3 functions are performed for 3 * 3 matrices only
   -> Each function takes it's own input.
   
   
Assignment 2 :

- Column Space
- Four fundamental subspaces : Column space, row space, null space, left null space

Remarks :
  -> The functions in assignment-2 can be used for any m X n matrices
  -> Dimension and Basis for every subspace is displayed
