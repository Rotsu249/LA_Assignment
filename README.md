SciLab Assignments for LA course -IVth Sem

Assignment 1 :

- Gaussian Elimination
- LU Decmposition
- Gauss Jordan

Remarks :
  - All 3 functions are performed for 3 * 3 matrices only
  - Each function takes it's own input.
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
Assignment 2 :

- Column Space
- Four fundamental subspaces : Column space, row space, null space, left null space

Remarks :
      - The functions in assignment-2 can be used for any m X n matrices
      - Dimension and Basis for every subspace is displayed
  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Assignment 3 :

- Best Fit Line

Remarks :
      - Takes n values for t and b (i.e n points) and finds best fit line for them
      - Scatter plot of the original points and the best fit line are plotted for better visualization
      - The error vector 'e' is also found out.
      - Verification that error('e') is minimum is also found out by checking whether the inner product of 'a' and 'e' is 0.
